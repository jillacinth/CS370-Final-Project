# CS370-Final-Project
Final Project using unsupervised learning and an Apriori algorithm to find the Pokemon your opponent is most likely to use against you and their possible team. The data is based on the VGC Pokemon World Championship 2022, using the Series 12 ruleset. The pokemon_teams.csv file includes the top 112 entries and the pokemon.csv file includes all the Pokmeon until Pokemon Sun and Moon. 
Here is the website I took the data from: [https://victoryroadvgc.com/2022/08/22/worlds-results/
